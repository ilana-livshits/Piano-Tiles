# Piano-Tiles
**Rhythm Tappers Prototype** <br />
**Group Members:** Ilana Livshits and Salvina Sharipova <br />
**Project Description:** <br />
Our final project follows a Piano Tiles configuration of a 4 column board of black tiles that appear to move down the screen. There will be several gameplay screens. One would instruct the player on user input in reference to their username, desired speed (which would accelerate as the game progresses), and preferred song (one or two songs would be synchronized with music, although a random assortment of tiles would initially be tested). The second screen, which would be switched to after the user presses “S” or “s”, would include the board of tiles moving down the screen. Tiles would be considered “pressed” and turn from black to gray when the user clicks on them. If a black tile touches the bottom edge of the screen, the player loses the game and their score (number of tiles they successfully clicked) is displayed. The player is able to restart the game by pressing R. <br />
